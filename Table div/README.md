1) ONLY HTML5, CSS3 based;

2) Pure JavaScript, no any other external libraries;

3) Columns implemented by table/table-row/table-cell;

4) The whole div(the main one with the width = 960px) is not fixed in height. So no matter how many items you put inside, it will just increase the length of the main div automatically without any element overflow. I put many items(the ones with the image size of 100* 100 and some texts in the middle column) on purpose to show this feature.

5) The modal. You can show any size of image in the modal. It's responsive for different images. And it is not only horizontally align center but also vertically align center without JavaScript. Also, the modal itself is horizontally/vertically aligned center too.

6) I tested my code on: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Edge and IE11.
